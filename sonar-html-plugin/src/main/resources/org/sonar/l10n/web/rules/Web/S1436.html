<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>This rule allows you to make sure that each HTML page contains an element with your configured ID, regardless of element type. This rule is useful,
for instance, if your design requires a placeholder to be present in each page, for example to dynamically insert a footer.</p>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<p>With a required id of "#footer":</p>
<pre>
&lt;div id="#footer"&gt;
...
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>With the creation of the HTML5 specification, many elements were deprecated, including <code>frame</code>, <code>frameset</code>, and
<code>noframes</code>. </p>
<p>While many of the other deprecations were motivated by a desire to clean up the specification, the <code>frame*</code> elements were deprecated
because: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>using them damages usability and accessibility</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore frames should be avoided.</p>

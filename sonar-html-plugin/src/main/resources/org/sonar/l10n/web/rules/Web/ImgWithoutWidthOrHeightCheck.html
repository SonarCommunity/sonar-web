<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>If the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes are set, the space required for the image is reserved immediately by the browser, even
before it actually starts to load the image.</p>
<p>Without those attributes, the page layout constantly changes as images are loaded until they are all loaded, which can disorient users.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
&lt;img src="logo.png" alt="My Company" /&gt;                           &lt;!-- Non-Compliant --&gt;
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
&lt;img src="logo.png" alt="My Company" width="100" height="50" /&gt;   &lt;!-- Compliant --&gt;
</pre>
